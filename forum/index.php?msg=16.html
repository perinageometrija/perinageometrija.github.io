									1) Bros before hoes. The bond between two men is stronger than that between a man and a woman because on an average, men are stronger than women. ThatĂ˘â,¬â,,˘s just science.<br /><br />2) A bro is always entitled to do something stupid as long as the rest of his bros are all doing it. For exampleĂ˘â,¬Â¦ If only one Spanish dude were to run down the street in front of a bunch of angry bulls, people would have been like Ă˘â,¬Ĺ"Dude, come on!!Ă˘â,¬Âť. The license to be stupid is why we have bros in the first place.<br /><br />3) If a bro gets a dog, it must be at least as tall as his knee when full-grown. Corollary to this states, naming a lap-dog after a pro-wrestler or a character from a Steve McLain movie does not absolve a bro from this article.<br /><br />4) A bro never divulges the existence of the Bro Code to a woman. It is a sacred document not to be shared with chicks for any reason.<br /><br />NOTE: If you are a woman reading this, first let me apologize: it was never my intention for this book to contain so much math. Second, I urge you to look at this document for what it is a piece of fiction meant to entertain a broad audience through the prism of stereotypical gender differences. I mean, sometimes it really is like weĂ˘â,¬â,,˘re from different planets! Clearly, no real person would actually believe or adhere to the vulgar rules contained within.* Those boots are adorable, b-t-dub.<br /><br />5) Whether he cares about sports or not, a bro cares about sports.<br /><br />6) A bro shall not lollygag if he must get naked in front of other bros in a gym locker room. Corollary to this states, if a bro gets naked in the locker room, all other bros shall pretend that nothing out of the ordinary is happening while at the same time immediately averting their eyes. When in doubt, remember the old adage. If your towel drops to the ground, so should your eyes.<br /><br />7) A bro never sends a greeting card to another bro. There are no sentiments between two bros that cannot be articulated through the convenience and emotional distance of electronic mail.<br /><br />8 ) A bro never admits he canĂ˘â,¬â,,˘t drive stick even after an accident.<br /><br />9) Should a bro lose a body part due to an accident or illness, his fellow bros will not make lame jokes such as Ă˘â,¬Ĺ"Gimme threeĂ˘â,¬Âť or Ă˘â,¬Ĺ"Wow!! Quitting your job like that really took a lot of ball!!Ă˘â,¬Âť ItĂ˘â,¬â,,˘s still a hi-five and that bro still has a lot of balls, metaphorically speaking of course.<br /><br />10) A bro will drop whatever he is doing and rush to help his bro dump a chick. ItĂ˘â,¬â,,˘s normal for a bro to get confused and disoriented when dumping a chick. For some reason he is worried she will become agitated or even violent after he calmly explains his desire to hook up with her friends. This is when a bro most needs his bro to remind him that there are plenty of chick in the ocean and that a breakup need not be hazardous, stressful or even time-consuming. How to dump a chick in 6 words or lessĂ˘â,¬Â¦<br /><br />- Ă˘â,¬Ĺ"Maybe try a side salad instead.Ă˘â,¬Âť<br />- Ă˘â,¬Ĺ"Cute!! You Ă˘â,¬Ëśre growing a moustache too!!Ă˘â,¬Âť<br />- Ă˘â,¬Ĺ"She looks like a younger you!!Ă˘â,¬Âť<br />- Ă˘â,¬Ĺ"I will finance a boob job.Ă˘â,¬Âť<br />- Ă˘â,¬Ĺ"Sorry I threw your shoes out.Ă˘â,¬Âť<br />- Ă˘â,¬Ĺ"Your sister let me do that!!Ă˘â,¬Âť<br /><br />11) A bro may ask another bro to help him move. But only after first disclosing an honest estimate on both time commitment and number of large furniture pieces. If the bro has vastly underestimated, either his bros retain the right to leave his possessions where they are, in most cases stuck in a door-way.<br /><br />12) Bros do not share dessert.<br /><br />13) All bros shall dub one of their bros his wingman.<br /><br />14) If a chick inquires about another brosĂ˘â,¬â,,˘ sexual history, a bro shall honor the Br-ode of silence and play dumb. Better to have women think that all men are stupid than to tell the truth.<br /><br />15) A bro never dances with his hands above his head.<br /><br />16) A bro should be able to recite anytime the following reigning champions: Super bowl, World series and Play Mate of the year.<br /><br />17) A bro shall be kind and courteous to his co-workers unless they are beneath him on the pyramid of screaming. America was built on the backs of men and women who were yelled at to work harder and the tradition has been screamed to generation from generation. But you just canĂ˘â,¬â,,˘t scream at anybody. You can only scream beneath you.<br /><br />18) If a bro spearheads a beer run at a party, he is entitled to any excess monies accrued after canvassing the group.<br /><br />Note: To avoid confrontation itĂ˘â,¬â,,˘s a good idea to jettison the receipt before returning to the party.<br /><br />19) A bro shall not sleep with another broĂ˘â,¬â,,˘s sister. However, a bro shall not get angry if another bro says Ă˘â,¬Ĺ"Dude, your sisterĂ˘â,¬â,,˘s hot!!Ă˘â,¬Âť. Corollary, it is probably better for everyone if bros just hide pictures of their sisters when other bros are coming over. When in doubt refer to the check list for bro-proofing your home.<br /><br />20) A Bro respects his Bros in the military because theyĂ˘â,¬â,,˘ve selflessly chosen to defend the nation, but more to the point, because they can kick his ass six ways to Sunday.<br /><br />21) A Bro never shares observations about another BroĂ˘â,¬â,,˘s smoking-hot girlfriend. Even if the Bro with the hot girlfriend attempts to bait the Bro by saying Ă˘â,¬Ĺ"sheĂ˘â,¬â,,˘s smoking-hot, huh?Ă˘â,¬Âť a Bro shall remain silent, because in this situation, heĂ˘â,¬â,,˘s the only one who should be baiting.<br /><br />22) There is no law that prohibits a woman from being a Bro. Women make excellent bros because they can translate and navigate the confusing and contradictory whims that comprise the chick code (Chick do have the chick code!!).<br /><br />23) When flipping through TV channels with his Bros, a Bro is not allowed to skip past a program featuring boobs. This includes but is not limited to, exercise shows, womenĂ˘â,¬â,,˘s athletics, and on some occasions surgery programs.<br /><br />24) When wearing a baseball cap, a Bro may position the brim at either 12 or 6 oĂ˘â,¬â,,˘clock. All other angles are reserved for rappers and the handicapped.<br /><br />25) A Bro doesnĂ˘â,¬â,,˘t let another Bro get a tattoo, particularly a tattoo of a girlĂ˘â,¬â,,˘s name. The average relationship between a man and a woman lasts 83 days. The relationship between man and his skin lasts a life time and must be nurtured because the skin is the largest and second most important organ a man has.<br /><br />26) Unless he has children, a Bro shall not wear his cell phone on a belt clip.<br /><br />27) A Bro never removes his shirt in front of other Bros, unless at a resort pool or the beach. Corollary, a bro with a coat of fur on his back, keeps that thing covered at all times even at resort, pool or beach.<br /><br />28) A Bro will, in a timely manner, alert his Bro to the existence of a fight between two fellow human beings of the female variety. If an informed bro is unable to witness the fight first hand, a spotter bro is responsible for documenting and relating details of girl fight via pictures, video or, barring any other reasonable method, interpretive dance and/or pantomime.<br /><br />29) If two Bros decide to catch a movie together, they may not attend a screening that begins after 4:40pm. Also despite the cost savings, they shall not split a tub of popcorn, choosing instead to procure individual bags.<br /><br />30) A Bro doesnĂ˘â,¬â,,˘t comparison shop.<br /><br />31) When on the prowl, a Bro hits on the hottest chick first because you just never know.<br /><br />32) A Bro doesnĂ˘â,¬â,,˘t allow another Bro to get married until heĂ˘â,¬â,,˘s at least thirty.<br /><br />33) When in a public restroom, a Bro (1) stares straight ahead when using the urinal; (2) makes the obligatory comment, Ă˘â,¬Ĺ"What is this, a chicksĂ˘â,¬â,,˘ restroom?Ă˘â,¬Âť if there are more than two dudes waiting to pee; and (3) attempts to basketball toss his used paper towel into the trash can like a basketballĂ˘â,¬Â¦rebounding is optional.<br /><br />34) Bros cannot make eye-contact during a DevilĂ˘â,¬â,,˘s Three-way.<br /><br />35) A Bro never rents a chick flick.<br /><br />36) DD: When questioned in the company of women, a Bro always decries fake breasts.<br /><br />37) A Bro is under no obligation to open a door for anyone. If women insist on having their own professional basketball league, then they can open their own doors. Honestly theyĂ˘â,¬â,,˘re not that heavy.<br /><br />38) Even in a fight to the death a Bro never punches another Bro in the groin.<br /><br />39) When a Bro gets a chicks number, he waits at least ninety-six hours before calling her. The reason is Bro-flation. An unreasonable increase in female expectations about how bros should act. You call a woman the next day, she tells her friends that you called the next day, and soon enough, women everywhere will expect guys to call them the next day. Before you know it, bros the world over will find themselves trapped in relationships and all because you couldnĂ˘â,¬â,,˘t wait 96 little hours.<br /><br />40) Should a Bro become stricken with engagement, his Bros shall stage an intervention and attempt to heal him. This is more commonly known as Ă˘â,¬Ĺ"a bachelor party.Ă˘â,¬Âť<br /><br />41) A Bro never cries. Exceptions Ă˘â,¬â€ś Watching Field of Dreams, ET or a sports legend retire (only first time he retires).<br /><br />42) Upon greeting another Bro, a Bro may engage in a high five, fist bump, or a Bro hug, but never a full embrace.<br /><br />43) A Bro loves his country, unless that country isnĂ˘â,¬â,,˘t America.<br /><br />44) A Bro never applies sunscreen to another Bro. Exceptions Ă˘â,¬â€ś If the Bros are within 7 degrees latitude of the equator.<br /><br />45) A Bro never wears jeans to a strip club. Reasons Ă˘â,¬â€ś a) Cloth pockets are roomier and elastic allowing for a thicker wad of cash. b) Denim clashes with the clubĂ˘â,¬â,,˘s leopard, zebra or other safari animal motif. c) One word, two syllables, three hours in the ER Ă˘â,¬â€ś Zipper. d) ItĂ˘â,¬â,,˘s a performance and deserves respect. e) You donĂ˘â,¬â,,˘t feel it as much on yourĂ˘â,¬Â¦ you know what..<br /><br />46) If a Bro is seated next to some dude whoĂ˘â,¬â,,˘s stuck in the middle seat on an airplane, he shall yield him all of their shared armrest, unless the dude has (a) taken his shoes off, (b) is snoring, (c) makes the Bro get up more than once to use the lavatory, or (d) purchased headphones after they announced the in-flight movie is 27 Dresses. See Article 35.<br /><br />47) A Bro never wears pink. Not even in Europe.<br /><br />48) A Bro never publicly reveals how many chicks heĂ˘â,¬â,,˘s banged. Corollary Ă˘â,¬â€ś A bro also never reveals how many chicks another Bro has banged.<br /><br />49) When asked, Ă˘â,¬Ĺ"Do you need some help?Ă˘â,¬Âť a Bro shall automatically respond, Ă˘â,¬Ĺ"I got it,Ă˘â,¬Âť whether or not heĂ˘â,¬â,,˘s actually got it. Exceptions Ă˘â,¬â€ś Carrying an expensive TV, parallel parking an expensive car and loading an expensive TV on to an expensive car.<br /><br />50) If a Bro should accidentally strike another BroĂ˘â,¬â,,˘s undercarriage with his arm while walking, both Bros silently agree to continue on as if it never happened.<br /><br />51) A Bro checks out another BroĂ˘â,¬â,,˘s blind date and reports back with a thumbs-up or thumbs-down.<br /><br />52) A Bro is not required to remember another Bros birthday, though a phone call every not and again probably wouldnĂ˘â,¬â,,˘t kill him.<br /><br />53) Even in a drought, a Bro flushes twice.<br /><br />54) A Bro is required to go out with his Bros on St. PaddyĂ˘â,¬â,,˘s Day and other official Bro holidays, including Halloween, New YearĂ˘â,¬â,,˘s Eve, and Desperation Day (February 13th)<br /><br />55) Even in an emergency that requires a tourniquet, a Bro never borrows from or lends clothes to another Bro.<br /><br />56) A Bro is required to alert another Bro if the Bro/chick Ration at a party falls below 1:1. However, to avoid Bro-flation, a Bro is only allowed to alert one Bro. Further, a Bro may not speculate on the anticipated Bro/Chick Ratio of a party or venue without first disclosing the present-time observed ratio.<br /><br />57) A Bro never reveals the score of a sporting event to another Bro unless that Bro has thrice confirmed he wants to hear it.<br /><br />58) A Bro doesnĂ˘â,¬â,,˘t grow a moustache. Exception Ă˘â,¬â€ś While shaving itĂ˘â,¬â,,˘s more than ok for a Bro to keep the whiskers around his mouth till the end so that he might temporarily experiment with different facial hair configurations.<br /><br />59) A Bro must always post bail for another Bro, unless itĂ˘â,¬â,,˘s out-of-state or, like, crazy expensive (Crazy expensive bail &gt;(years youĂ˘â,¬â,,˘ve been bros) x $100)<br /><br />60) A Bro shall honor they father and mother, for they were once Bro and chick. However, a Bro never thinks of them in that capacity.<br /><br />61) If a Bro for whatever reason becomes aware of another BroĂ˘â,¬â,,˘s anniversary with a chick, he shall endeavor to make that information available to his Bro, regardless of whether he thinks his Bro already knows.<br /><br />62) In the event that two Bros lock on to the same target, the Bro who calls dibs first has dibs. If both call dibs at the same time, the Bro who counts aloud to ten the fastest has dibs. If both arrive at the number ten at the same time, the Bro who bought the last round of drinks has dibs. If they havenĂ˘â,¬â,,˘t purchased drinks yet, the taller of the two Bros has dibs. If theyĂ˘â,¬â,,˘re the same height, the Bro with the longer dry spell has dibs. Should the dry spells be of equal length, a game of discreet Broshambo* shall determine dibs, provided the chick is still there. *Rock, paper, scissors for Bros.<br /><br />63) A Bro will make any and all efforts to provide his Bro with protection. Bro-tection forms a central pillar or, more accurately, a plastic coating for the central pillar of the Bro way of life.<br /><br />While not legally or physically responsible for any repercussions of failing to provide protection, itĂ˘â,¬â,,˘s not uncommon for a Bro to experience pangs of guilt after a fellow Bro becomes infected with a disease. Some of which, such as children, can last an entire lifetime.<br /><br />64) A Bro must provide his Bro with a ticket to an event if said event involves the second BroĂ˘â,¬â,,˘s favorite sports team in a playoff scenario.<br /><br />65) A Bro must always reciprocate a round of drinks among Bros. Exception Ă˘â,¬â€ś A Bro is off the hook if a Bro orders a drink with an umbrella in it.<br /><br />66) If a Bro suffers pain due to the permanent dissolution of a relationship with a lady friend, a Bro shall offer nothing more than a Ă˘â,¬Ëśthat sucks, manĂ˘â,¬â,,˘ and copious quantities of beer. A Bro will also refrain from pejorative commentary Ă˘â,¬â€ś deserved or not Ă˘â,¬â€ś regarding said lady friend for a period of three months, when the requisite BACKSLIDE WINDOW has closed.<br /><br />67) Should a Bro pick up a guitar at a party and commence playing, another Bro shall point out that he is a tool.<br /><br />68) If a Bro be on hot streak, another Bro will do everything possible to ensure its longevity, even if that includes jeopardizing his own records, the missing of work, or, if necessary, generating a realistic fear that the end of the world is imminent. Exception Ă˘â,¬â€ś Dry spell trumps hot streak.<br /><br />69) Duh.<br /><br />70) A Bro will drive another Bro to the airport or pick him up, but never both for the same trip. He is not expected to be on time, help with luggage, or inquire about his BroĂ˘â,¬â,,˘s trip or general well-being.<br /><br />71) As a courtesy to Bros the world over, a Bro never brings more than two other Bros to a party. Three Bros are cool Ă˘â,¬â€ś Three amigos, Three musketeers, The police, Apollo 13 Astronauts and the Three stooges. Four Bros are lame Ă˘â,¬â€ś Mount Rushmore, The Fantastic Four, The Monkeys and Michael JordanĂ˘â,¬â,,˘s team mates.<br /><br />72) A Bro never spell-checks.<br /><br />73) When a group of Bros are in a restaurant, each shall engage in the time-honored ritual of jockeying to pay the bill, regardless of affordability. When the group ultimately decides to divide the check, each Bro shall act upset rather that enormously relieved.<br /><br />74) At a red light, a Bro inches as close as possible to the rear bumper of the car in front of him, and then immediately honks his horn when the light turns green. That way if another Bro is several cars behind, heĂ˘â,¬â,,˘ll have a better chance of making it through the intersection before the light turns red again.<br /><br />75) A Bro automatically enhances another BroĂ˘â,¬â,,˘s job description when introducing him to a chick. Chicks like to stretch the truth about their age, promiscuity and sometimes, with the help of extensive make-up and structural lingerie, even their body shape. As such, it is a fair game for Bros to exaggerate reality when asked about their Bro-fession.<br /><br />76) If a Bro is on the phone with a chick while in front of his Bros and, for whatever reason, desires to say Ă˘â,¬Ĺ"I love youĂ˘â,¬Âť he shall first excuse himself from the room or employ a subsonic Barry White-esque tone.<br /><br />77) Bros donĂ˘â,¬â,,˘t cuddle.<br /><br />78) A Bro shall never rack jack his wingman. Rack jack is to steal your wingmanĂ˘â,¬â,,˘s chick. To commemorate and solidify the unbreakable bond between the Bro and his wingman, it is recommended that before going out, each face the other, place his left hand on the Bro code, raise his right hand, and recite the wingman pledge.<br /><br />79) At a wedding, Bros shall reluctantly trudge out for the garter toss and feign interest for the benefit of the chicks present. Whichever Bro gets stuck with the garter shall light-heartedly pretend heĂ˘â,¬â,,˘s not mortified at the thought of being the next one to drop before scurrying to the bar for a very stiff drink and/or shots.<br /><br />80) A bro shall make every effort to aid another Bro in riding the tricycle (engaging in a threesome), short of completing the tricycle himself. The total age of all the three should be less than 83.<br /><br />81) A Bro leaves the toilet seat up for his Bros.<br /><br />82) If two Bros get into a heated argument over something and one says something out of line, the other shall not expect him to take it back or apologize to make amends. ThatĂ˘â,¬â,,˘s inhuman.<br /><br />83) A Bro shall, at all costs, honor the Platinum Rule: Never, ever, ever, ever Ă˘â,¬Âť loveĂ˘â,¬Âť thy neighbor. In particular, a Bro shall never mix it up romantically with a co-worker. Exceptions Ă˘â,¬â€ś Coworker is an 8 or better, you are superior to the coworker, coworker dresses a little slutty, company recently sued for sexual harassment, someone makes a bet that you canĂ˘â,¬â,,˘t, you are switching floors soon, you and coworker get stuck in elevator, coworker soon to be fired, coworker hits on you, coworker going through divorce, coworker not offended when you accidentally email provocative self pictures to office.<br /><br />84) Bro shall stop whatever heĂ˘â,¬â,,˘s doing and watch Die Hard if itĂ˘â,¬â,,˘s on TV. Corollary Ă˘â,¬â€ś Also the Shawshank Redemption, Top Gun, first half of Full Metal Jacket.<br /><br />85) If a Bro buys a new car, he is required to pop the hood when showing it off to his Bros. Corollary Ă˘â,¬â€ś His Bros are required to whistle, even if they donĂ˘â,¬â,,˘t know what they are whistling at.<br /><br />86) When a Bro meets a chick he shall endeavor to find out where she fits on the Hot/Crazy Scale before pursuing her.<br /><br />87) A Bro never questions another BroĂ˘â,¬â,,˘s stated golf score, maximum bench press, or height. He can however, ask the Bro to prove it, traditionally in the form of a wager.<br /><br />88) If a Bro, for whatever reason must drive another BroĂ˘â,¬â,,˘s car, he shall not adjust the preprogrammed radio stations, the mirrors, or the seat position, even if this last requirement results in the Bro trying to drive the vehicle as a giant praying mantis would.<br /><br />89) A Bro shall always say yes in support of a Bro.

									90) A Bro shows up at another BroĂ˘â,¬â,,˘s party with at least one more unit of alcohol than he plans to drink. So if a Bro plans on chugging a six pack, he shall bring a six pack plus at least one can of beer. If the party sucks and/or there are too many dudes, the Bro is entitled to leave with his alcohol, though etiquette dictates he should wait until nobody is looking.<br /><br />91) If a group of Bros suspect that their Bro is trying to give himself a nickname, they shall rally to call him by an adjacent yet more demeaning nickname.<br /><br />92) A Bro keeps his booty calls at a safe distance.<br /><br />93) Bros donĂ˘â,¬â,,˘t speak French to each other.<br /><br />94) If a Bro is in the bathroom and runs out of toilet paper, another Bro may toss him a new roll, but at no point may their hands touch or the door open more than 30 degrees from fully closed.<br /><br />95) A Bro shall alert another Bro to the presence of a chesty woman regardless of whether or not he knows the Bro.

Exception: A Bro may as for directions for a hot chick who seems to know the area. A Bro may ask for directions from a hot chick even if she also appears lost. A Bro may ask for directions from a hot chick even if he himself is not lost at all.<br /><br />100) When pulling up to a stoplight, a Bro lowers his window so that all might enjoy his music selection. Corollary: If there happens to be a hot chick driving the car next to the Bro, the Bro shall pull his sunglasses down to get a better look. If heĂ˘â,¬â,,˘s not wearing his sunglasses, he will first put them on, then pull them down to get a better look.<br /><br />101) If a Bro asks another Bro to keep a secret, he shall take that secret to his grave and beyond if the Bro discovers there is indeed life after death. This is what makes them Bros, not chicks.<br /><br />102) A Bro shall take great care in selecting and training his wingman.<br /><br />103) A Bro never wears socks with sandals. He commits to one cohesive footgear plan and sticks with it.<br /><br />104) The mom of a Bro is always off-limits. But the stepmom of a Bro is fair game if she initiates and /or is wearing at least one article of leopard print clothingĂ˘â,¬Â¦provided she looks good in itĂ˘â,¬Â¦but not if she smokes menthol cigarettes.<br /><br />105) If a Bro is not invited to another BroĂ˘â,¬â,,˘s wedding, he doesnĂ˘â,¬â,,˘t make a big deal out of it, even if, letĂ˘â,¬â,,˘s face it, he was kind of responsible for setting up the couple and had already picked out the perfect wedding gift and everything. ItĂ˘â,¬â,,˘s cool. No big whoop.<br /><br />106) Given an option on quantity when ordering a beer with his Bros, a Bro always selects the largest size available or shall never hear the end of it that night.<br /><br />107) A Bro never leaves another Bro hanging.<br /><br />108) If a Bro forgets a guyĂ˘â,¬â,,˘s name he may call him Ă˘â,¬Ĺ"brahĂ˘â,¬Âť,Ă˘â,¬ÂťdudeĂ˘â,¬Âť, or Ă˘â,¬Ĺ"manĂ˘â,¬Âť but never Ă˘â,¬Ĺ"BroĂ˘â,¬Âť.<br /><br />109) When Bros attend a sporting event and see themselves on the JumboTron, they shall purse their lips and flex their biceps while informing the crowd that their team is number one, despite any objective rankings to the contrary.<br /><br />110) If a Bro is hitting it off with a chick, his Bro shall do anything within his means to ensure the desired outcome.<br /><br />111) If a Bro discovers another Bro has forgotten to sign out of his email the Bro will sign out for him, but only after first sending a few angry emails to random contacts and then deleting all sent messages.<br /><br />112) A Bro doesnĂ˘â,¬â,,˘t sing along to music in a bar. Exception: A Bro may participate in karaoke. Exception to exception: No chick songs.<br /><br />113) A Bro abides by the accepted age-difference formula when pursuing a young chick<br />Acceptable age difference formula: ChickĂ˘â,¬â,,˘s age = (GuyĂ˘â,¬â,,˘s age divided by 2) + 7<br /><br />114) If a Bro must crash on his BroĂ˘â,¬â,,˘s couch for an extended period of time, he shall offer to split the cost of toilet paper and the cable bill if said period exceeds two weeks. If he stays longer than a month, he shall offer to contribute some rent. If he stays longer than two months, he shall steam clean the couch or have it incinerated, whichever is more applicable.<br /><br />115) A Ă˘â,¬Ĺ"clothing optionalĂ˘â,¬Âť beach doesnĂ˘â,¬â,,˘t really mean Ă˘â,¬Ĺ"clothing optionalĂ˘â,¬Âť for Bros.<br /><br />116) A Bro shall not kill another Bro or that BrosĂ˘â,¬â,,˘ chances to score with a chick.<br /><br />117) A Bro never willingly relinquishes possession of a remote control. If another Bro desires a channel change, he may verbally request one or engage in the foolĂ˘â,¬â,,˘s errand of getting up to manually change the channel. Corollary Ă˘â,¬â€ś It is fully expected that a Bro will try anything to gain possession of the remote up to and including an attempt to flatulate his Bro out of the room.<br /><br />118) When a Bro is with his Bros, he is not a vegetarian.<br /><br />119) When three Bros must share the backseat of a car, it is unacceptable for any Bro to put his arm around another Bro to increase space. Likewise, it is unacceptable for two Bros to share a motorcycle, unless said motorcycle is equipped with a sidecarĂ˘â,¬Â¦a Brotorcycle.<br /><br />120) A Bro always calls another Bro by his last name.<br /><br />121) Even if heĂ˘â,¬â,,˘s never skied before, a Bro doesnĂ˘â,¬â,,˘t trifle with the bunny slope.

Always.<br /><br />123) Two Bros shall maintain at least a three-foot radius between them while dancing on the same floor, even when reenacting the knife fight from Ă˘â,¬Ĺ"Beat ItĂ˘â,¬Âť which, I guess, two Bros shouldnĂ˘â,¬â,,˘t do anyway, or at least not very often.<br /><br />124) If a Bro should shoot an air ball, strike out while playing softball, or throw a gutter ball while Browling, he is required to make some sort of excuse for himself.<br /><br />125) If a Bro is driving ahead of another Bro in a Bro Train, he is required to attempt to lose him in traffic as a funny joke.<br /><br />126) In a scenario where two or more Bros are watching entertainment of the adult variety, one Bro is forbidden from intentionally or unintentionally touching another Bro in ANY capacity. This may include but is not limited to: the high five, the fist bump or the congratulatory gluteal pat. Winking is also kind of a no-no.<br /><br />127) A Bro will always help another Bro reconstruct the events from the previous night, unless those events entail hooking up with an ugly chick or the Bro repeatedly saying Ă˘â,¬Ĺ"I love you, manĂ˘â,¬Âť to all his Bros.<br /><br />128) A Bro never wears two articles of clothing at the same time that bear the same school name, vacation destination or sports team. Even in a laundry emergency, its preferred that a Bro go out half-naked rather than violate this codeĂ˘â,¬Â¦half naked from the waist up, naturally.<br /><br />129) If a Bro lends another Bro a DVD, video game, or piece of lawn machinery, he shall not expect to ever get it back, unless his Bro happens to die and bequeath it back to him.<br /><br />130) If a Bro learns another Bro has been in a traffic accident, he must first ask what type of car he collided with and whether it got totaled before asking if his Bro is okay.<br /><br />131) While a Bro is not expected to know exactly how to change a tire, he is required to at least drag out the jack and stare at the flat for a while. If he needs to consult the carĂ˘â,¬â,,˘s ownership manual to locate the jack, he shall do so from inside the car, where he is not visible to passersby and where he can discreetly call a tow truck, after which it is recommended that he hide the&nbsp; jack by the side of the road so heĂ˘â,¬â,,˘ll have a legitimate excuse when the tow truck arrives.<br /><br />132) If a Bro decides to let all of his Bros down and get married, he is required to invite them to the wedding, even if this directly violates the wishes of his fiancĂÂ©e and results in a Ă˘â,¬Ĺ"no sexĂ˘â,¬Âť penalty or whatever lame domestic punishment couples might employ.<br /><br />133) A Bro only claims a fart after first accusing at least one other Bro. Exception Ă˘â,¬â€ś Pull my finger.<br /><br />134) A Bro is entitled to use a woman as his wingman.<br /><br />135) If a scenario arises in which a Bro has promised two of his Bros permanent shotgun, one of the following shall determine the copilot: (a) foot race to the car, (b) silent auction or in the case of a road trip exceeding 450 miles, (c) a no-holds-barred cage match to the death.<br /><br />136) When interrogated by a girlfriend about a bachelor party, a Bro shall offer nothing more than a disinterested Ă˘â,¬Ĺ"It was okayĂ˘â,¬Âť. A Bro can never bring a camera back from a bachelor party. The only memento a Bro is allowed to bring back is something that can be destroyed by penicillin.<br /><br />137) When hosting, a Bro orders enough pizza for all his Bros.<br /><br />138) A real Bro doesnĂ˘â,¬â,,˘t laugh when a guy gets hit in the groin. Exception: Unless he doesnĂ˘â,¬â,,˘t know the guy.<br /><br />139) Regardless of veracity, a Bro never admits familiarity with a Broadway show or musical, despite the fact that, yes, Ă˘â,¬Ĺ"BroadwayĂ˘â,¬Âť begins with Ă˘â,¬Ĺ"BroĂ˘â,¬Âť.<br /><br />140) A Bro reserves the right to simply walk away during the first five minutes of a date. (Lemon Law).<br /><br />141) A Bro can only get a manicure if (a) heĂ˘â,¬â,,˘s trying to sleep with the hot Asian woman performing the manicure, or (b) its been longer than a month since his last manicure. Its called the Bro Code, not the slob Code.<br /><br />142) A Bro shall seek no revenge if he passes out around his Bros and wakes up to find marker all over his face.<br /><br />143) When executing a high five a Bro is forbidden from intertwining fingers or grasping his BroĂ˘â,¬â,,˘s hand.<br /><br />144) It is unacceptable for two Bros to share a hotel bed without first exhausting all couch, cot, and pillows-on-floor combinations. If itĂ˘â,¬â,,˘s still unavoidable, they shall prevent any incidental spoonage by arm wrestling to determine who sleeps under the covers. Once decided each Bro shall don as many lower layers as possible before silently fist bumping the other good night.<br /><br />145) A Bro is never offended if another Bro fails to return a phone call, text or email in a timely fashion.<br /><br />146) A Bro refrains from using too much detail when relating sexual exploits to his Bros. Providing graphic detail unconsciously forces your Bros to picture you naked and there is no coming back from that.<br /><br />147) If a Bro sees another Bro get into a fight, he immediately has his BroĂ˘â,¬â,,˘s back. Exception: If his Bro has picked a fight with a scary looking guy. If this is the third fight (or more) his Bro has gotten into that week. If the Bro has a note from a physician excusing him from having anybodyĂ˘â,¬â,,˘s back.<br /><br />148) A Bro doesnĂ˘â,¬â,,˘t listen to chick musicĂ˘â,¬Â¦in front of other Bros. When alone, a Bro may listen to, say, a Sarah McLachlan album or two, but only to gain valuable insights into the female psyches, not because he finds her melodies tragically haunting yet curiously uplifting at the same time.<br /><br />149) A Bro pretends to understand and enjoy cigars.<br /><br />150) No sex with your BroĂ˘â,¬â,,˘s ex. It is never ever permissible for a Bro to sleep with his BroĂ˘â,¬â,,˘s ex. Violating this code is worse than killing a Bro.
